        We want to create friendships between users with accounts in our database.
        Long term we want to make video recommendations based on what friends are
        bookmarking. This card should not include the recommendation logic. That''s
        coming in a different user story.\r\n\r\n**Background:** A user (Josh) exists
        in the system with a Github token. The user has two followers on Github. One
        follower (Dione) also has an account within our database. The other follower
        (Mike) does not have an account in our system. If a follower or following
        has an account in our system we want to include a link next to their name
        to allow us to add as a friend.\r\n\r\nIn this case Dione would have an *Add
        as Friend* link next to her name. Mike would not have the link next to his
        name.\r\n\r\n**Tips:** No need to work on edge cases during your spike. You''ll
        want to research self referential has_many through. Here''s a good starting
        point to understand the concept: http://blog.hasmanythrough.com/2007/10/30/self-referential-has-many-through.
