        We want to create friendships between users with accounts in our database.
        Long term we want to make video recommendations based on what friends are
        bookmarking. This card should not include the recommendation logic. That''s
        coming in a different user story.\r\n\r\n**Background:** A user (Josh) exists
        in the system with a Github token. The user has two followers on Github. One
        follower (Dione) also has an account within our database. The other follower
        (Mike) does not have an account in our system. If a follower or following
        has an account in our system we want to include a link next to their name
        to allow us to add as a friend.\r\n\r\nIn this case Dione would have an *Add
        as Friend* link next to her name. Mike would not have the link next to his
        name.\r\n\r\n**Tips:** No need to work on edge cases during your spike. You''ll
        want to research self referential has_many through. Here''s a good starting
        point to understand the concept: http://blog.hasmanythrough.com/2007/10/30/self-referential-has-many-through.
        You''ll probably need to do more googling but that''s part of the fun ;)\r\n\r\n-
        [ ] Links show up next to followers that have accounts in our system.\r\n-
        [ ] Links show up next to followings that have accounts in our database.\r\n-
        [ ] Links do not show up next to followers or followings if they are not in
        our database.\r\n- [ ] There''s a section on the dashboard that shows all
        of the users that I have friended\r\n- [ ] Edge Case: Make sure this fails
        gracefully. If you open up a POST route to create a friendship, be sure to
        catch the scenario where someone sends an invalid user id. Send a flash message
        alerting them of the error.","closed_by":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}'
